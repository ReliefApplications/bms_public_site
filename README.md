Humansis (formerly Akezi)
==============

## About

A platform that allows humanitarian organisations to manage relief items (Food, Non Food Items, CASH) to people in need for life-saving humanitarian responses to emergency situations.

Humansis is the first fully open-source relief platform for humanitarian actors to efficiently manage relief operations after a disaster, during a war or in response to long term crises. 

If you're an experienced dev and you'd like to get involved, contact us on Twitter by DM :  [@reliefapps](https://twitter.com/Reliefapps).
